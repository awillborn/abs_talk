# Notes: The quest for an evolutionary understanding of consciousness—Darwin to present


so VTE in Tolman's sense vs the micro-VTE involved BItRIP

Problem of pollinator constancy
other kinds of choice points are interesting too: pollinator!





Two tensions, two senses of 'molar'

tolman said you need to be Molar in his sense

the careful use of mentalistic concepts has re-emerged in many areas of animal behavior research, as understanding behavior in terms of the cognitive, intentional and affective states of animals has proven to be both fruitful and perfectly compatible with experimental rigor.

mabye we want to 'bracket' or not bracket but 'back-burner' sociality/intersubjectivity? even though that stuff is so important and cool, i want to foreground temporality both because its something i think maybe we think about a bit less? and also because i think its more fundamental in a pretty important sense — any aspects of intersubjective consciousness must unfold against a background of temporality, temporality will be there as a structural dimension as it is for all conscious experience, so it's useful to discuss first. its only fair to point out that some philosophers disagree and do put intersubjectivity at a more fundamental level . but they are wrong



social recognition, intersubjectivity...

body as organizing principle in spatial cognition?

Affect as gap bridging concept surrounding action selection, takes many different forms in different theoretical contexts:

* reinforcement
* reward
* drive
* emotion
* goal attractance 
* homeostasis



Here I present some philosophical ideas which may be less known to experimentalists, but may serve useful in hypothesizing about how animals make their ways in the world and how these ways of life develop and evolve:


intentionality is temporalized
temporality has a structure
our awareness of everything else unfolds against that temporalized structure, our awareness of our body as the medium of perception and action, our awareness of our environment, the things in it and the events that happen, all of this 
embodiment/object intentionality
temporality
theory of affect


 

Molar behavior:
“Momentary behavior” is an oxymoron. By its very nature, behavior is extended in time. If Tom is sitting on the bus, we cannot tell if he is going home, to the store, or somewhere else. A momentary snapshot is subject to maximal uncertainty; only with a larger time sample do we become certain about what Tom is doing.
The temptation to posit private events arises when an activity is viewed on too small a time scale. If we view a snapshot of a moment, we see, for example, Tom with a shovel in the garden, but we have little idea what activity is occurring. Viewing over a slightly longer timeframe, we see that Tom is digging a hole. Viewing on a scale longer than that, we see that Tom is digging a ditch. Longer still, and we see he is laying a pipeline. Longer than that, and we see he is installing a waterfall in his garden. And so on. At each time scale, we see public activity, and no problem arises. But, let Tom stop for a while and lean on his shovel, looking at the ground; then the temptation arises to suppose he is thinking privately about his project. However, we don't know what he is doing at that moment; he might be resting or thinking about getting something to eat. In a larger time frame, we might see that he resumes digging after a while, and even though he took a short break, he is still working on his project. Whatever covert speech may have occurred hardly matters, because Tom is engaged during the period of observation in the activity of digging a ditch, laying a pipeline, or installing a waterfall. Seen on a longer time scale, the activity is continuous, and any private events that occur may be ignored ([Baum, 2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3211378/#bhan-34-02-06-Baum3)).
Behaviorism, Private Events, and the Molar View of Behavior [William M Baum](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Baum%20WM%5BAuthor%5D&cauthor=true&cauthor_uid=22532740)


Tolman had a different definition, where 'molar' meant that the unit of analysis was the behavior act as a whole; the contrast was to see behavior as a collection of mechanisms or something:

“(Watson) has defined behavior in terms of the strict underling physical and physiological details, i.e., in terms of receptor-process, conductor-process, and effector-process per se. We shall designate this as the molecular definition of behavior. And, on the other hand, he as come to recognize, albeit perhaps but dimly that behavior, as such is more than and different from the sum of its physiological parts. Behavior, as such, is an 'emergent' phenomenon that has descriptive and defining properties of its own. And we shall designate this latter as the molar definition of behavior...
It will be contentded by us (if not by Watson) that “Behavior-acts”, though no doubt in complete one-to-one correspondence with the underlying molecular facts of physics and physiology, have as 'molar' wholes, certain emergent properties of their own. And it is these, the molar properties of behavior-acts, which are of prime interest to us as psychologists.”

What are these properties?

“To sum up, the complete descriptive identification of any behavior act per se requires descriptive statements relative to:

1. the goal-object or objects, being got to or from,
2. the specific pattern of commerces with means-objects involved in this getting to or from
3. the facts exhibited relative to the selective identification of routes and means-objects as involving short (easy) commerces with means-objects for thus getting to or from.” p 12


“But surely any 'tough minded' reader will by now be up in arms. For it is clear that thus to identify behaviors in terms of goal-objects, and patterns of commerces with means-objects as selected short ways to get to or from the goal-objects, is to imply something perilously like purposes and cognitions. And this surely will be offensive to any hard headed, well brought up psychologist of the present day.
And yet, there seems to be no other way out. Behavior as behavior, that is, as molar, *is* purposive and *is* cognitive. These purposes and cognitions are of its immediate descriptive warp and woof.” p 12-13
 
So to be molar in Tolman's sense is to understand the integration process, not just the forces that apply pressure to that integration process. So skinner is molecular in that view 





 
“Affect-emotions arise from an extremely extended network that can be seen in affect’s composite nature. Affect links virtually every type of quality that the organism manifests. This spans the most elementary homeostatic detection of biological needs by the hypothalamic systems, to the most subtle analysis of the intentions of others in a complex social milieu using cortical modules of both verbal and nonverbal categorization.”
-Varela and Depraz

that IS a good point about valence in general—ANYthing can have it. or like, almost anything can acquire arbitrary valenced associations. (i mean, that's not totally true, there are lots of exceptions) but why, to the extent it is even true?





so affective frames

when you percieve something you percieve ‘in the frame’ of the current global context, your awareness of all sorts of present objects and conditions, perhaps also together with recollection, prospection, imagination… each of these things carry with them their own ‘affective frame’, that contributes to the overall affective framing context.

so there is ‘frame’ in the context of the way your current affective set influences your perception of the object

your awareness of the object unfolds in a series of acts of associating sensory or motor microfeatures, some of which can be though of as purely ‘exteroceptive’ 

the frame is just activation in the network related to an object... super vague
but it has a frame of activated associations...

as perception of the object begins to unfold, the first sensory info comes in, its received in a contextual affective frame that lends some salience or other to it, perhaps a great amount, bringing it to the attentive focus in some way. but in what way? in preparing to immediately interact with it, for example by grasping it with the hand?

this region of the network isn't just the frame in the sense of the context 

cool example from darwin, muscles around the eyes reflexively connected to breathing, to protect the eyes from spikes in blood pressure?



why would Darwin (or anyone) think that instinct isn't conscious?

Cartesian language/reason kind of assumptions? unlikely for D cuz like emotions stuff? unless 'consciousness' meant something different for him.

Lorenz critiques Skinner p 69-x of *Foundations*

Lorenz talking about 'insight' at the end of his discussion of mechanisms using 'instant information' — this is like the problem of performance, or like 'why does the animal actually do what it does'; but the discussion kind of focuses on NONlearned stuff, because L is trying to draw the contrast between these 'instant information' mechanisms and learning; but these mechanisms are like tuned by learning right?

in this discussion L does turn to like virtual action in a 'visualized space' to explain how humans and 'higher animals' do the shit. whereas for praying mantis specifying a a suite of functional mechanisms is sufficient.

“Phenomenology is-contrary to the opinions of some-a legitimate source of knowledge” K. Lorenz, *Foundations *p 241


do spiders sing for fun like birds?

science is different now than in skinner's day, not trying to legimitize self, trying to integrate everything.
theoretical gaps in the bracketing assumptions of skinner's picture:

the ‘problem of affect’’ is: how does learning actually influence behavior?

why do different contingencies affect a learner differently? what explains the laws of reinforcement schedule?

response topography doesn’t matter — how do all the sequences of movements that could constitute the ‘behavior’ as measured by the experimental observer hang together? why those movements and not others? what determined which combination occurred?

A DAY OF GREAT ILLUMINATION: B. F. SKINNER’S DISCOVERY OF SHAPING GAIL B. PETERSON

so response topography does matter... 

the other ‘problem of affect’: how does evolution actually influence behavior? how does evolution influence learning/development of behavior? what are the causal processes underlying the influence of phylogenetic contingencies on actual instances of behavior?

what we find is that genes control hormones and simple changes in hormones underlie variation in some dimension of how complex behavior is performed … like genes can control timing of onset, duration, extent of development or expression of behaviors, but where do the actual behaviors come from?

but like, how do novel behaviors arise in evolution?
behavioral flixbility is key in evolution more generally too

jackson portia spitting spider thing. how in the absofuck does that work?

how do novel behaviors arise in ontogeny?

one answer: animals have consciousness—boundedly flexible, self-correcting way of extracting an *understanding* of an environment in relation to its needs, of attempting to “compute a lifeway”

it should be kept in mind that in a sense consciousness is 'built out of associative learning', since it emerges through the development of an embodied brain, and it is the network dynamics of the brain that underlie its ability to store information and to compute goal-directed behavioral solutions from sensory flow.

the brain is an associative learning engine, but as they mature, learning networks gain structure, and structured networks behave and learn in ways that are very different from the simple laws of the Behaviorists. The cognitive phenotypes of animals are self-constructing and self-scaffolding, as well as inter-constructing and inter-scaffolding.

To attribute consciousness to an animal is to attribute a certain structure to the living computational network that is its animated body. Of course, the content of the theory of consciousness one has in mind when making the attribution certainly matters.

I will unabashedly admit to favoring a version of the phenomenological theory of consciousness, following in the framework invented by Husserl. 

this is not vacuous, it makes empirical predictions, and likewise it can offer substantive explanations


why should animal behaviorists care?

Michelle Maiese. How can emotions be both cognitive and bodily?

yeah so when thinking about the connection between 'emotions' in a phenomenological contedxt...

one super important thing about emotions is the way they change how you learn — you can be fear conditioned or yums conditioned to a room or a person or an object depending on what happens ot you around it, but also your perception fo the connection to the object matters too (so even for insects — in that paper there is the distinction between context-stimulus learning and habituation...)

interestingly, this isn't part of the phenomenology is it? maybe? maybe you're like "i shouldn't have..." or "i'll never X again"

I dunno, so the question is, is the tendency of mood to change how perceiving events 'cause you to learn', i.e. change the way you think and respond to perceived events in the future? that would be a pretty complicated intentional object...

i think nah, for the most part, we aren't aware that we're being changed by our moods and perceptions, our sense of self remains constant... maybe there are moments... i remember thinking that my experience with annie would change the way i thought about people, would make me less trusting, but that's maybe an unusual experience.

this is all separate even from the connection to action selection, 'guiding behavior' in enactive terms, but that shit super matters too. like in terms of intentional content of fear, it makes a huge diff whether you are like afraid of something that you are looking at and trying to prevent, like a dog trying to bite you... or running away from something, those even are very different ways of 'doing something fearfully', and that's so different from being scared of something you know to not yet be present... imagine knowing that something dangerous is coming in a certain amount of time, and you need to get your things together and get in the car and leave. then think about the difference that it makes to your emotional experience whether that amount of time is 1 minute, 10 minutes, 10 days, a year... you might be scared in all cases ('equally scared'? how do you measure fear)

but so the point maybe is that how you are expressing the motivational component of the emotion in action currently, affects your experience of the emotion.

"And once I am angry, this emotion lends shape and contour to how I make sense of my surroundings. Emotions are not simply a matter of reactivity, but also modes of responsivity that shape subsequent cognitive processing."

cool, affective framing seems like a super useful notion


"What I call ‘affective framing’ is the process whereby we make sense of persons, objects, facts, states of affairs, ourselves, etc. in terms of feelings of caring. One way to describe an affective frame is as “affective mode of presentation” whereby “significant events or states of affairs [are] disclosed through diffuse, holistic bodily feelings” (Slaby 2008, 447). The term ‘affective framing’ is meant to capture the idea that emotions are a matter of active appraisal, and also that bodily affectivity permeates our interpretations and patterns of attention. Affective framing is a spontaneous, non-inferential, and pre-reflective way of discriminating, filtering, and selecting information that allows us to reduce the overwhelming clutter of information to something first-personally manageable and confer upon it spe- cific cognitive significance... Such framing determines subjects’ attentive focus, right down to the most fine-grained levels, and thereby fixes precisely which features of their surroundings become salient for them."

but isn't it actually more than this because on my view affective weighting plays a big role in protention collapse...

what about hierarchy? can you emotional framings within emotional framings?
does this help to capture the scope range of 'emotions', like disgust when glancing at poop to depression lasting months... if affective framing is applied to any kind of object-oriented intentionality, then it could apply cleanly to anything from long-lasting situations to quick glimpses of something vaguely yucky.

but does this WORK? is it accurate? i mean, the human condition is determined by an actual set of concrete emotional systems, not the whoel possible range, so does it capture the range of cases? what would be missing... can we use this 'frame'work (lol) to capture emotional/motivational systems?
and does this just work with humean associative-learning driven picture of the mind? seems to work pretty nicely

so 'affective framing' is pretty great

“The dimensions of our bodies and the spaces moved through by our limbs serve us as standards of comparison with environing dimensions and conceptions of smallness or largeness result according as these environing dimensions are much less or much greater than the organic dimensions Hence the consciousness of a given relation of two positions in space must vary quantitatively with variation of bodily bulk Clearly a mouse which has to run many times its own length to traverse the space which a man traverses at a stride cannot have the same conception of this space as a man Quantitative changes in these compound” -Spencer https://books.google.com/books?id=27TFIv6p6uoC&pg=PA210&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false

p 454 “we can only judge by the circumstances under which actions are performed, whether tey are due to instinct, or to reason, or to the mere association of ideas: this latter principle, however, is intimately connected with reason.”
D does think associative learning is a big part of intelligence, cognition. also stuff earlier about how behaviors can transition from learned to instinctive...


p 454-455, D is talking about this general graded power of forming associations/reasoning, fish are dumb, dogs less dumb, and babies even less dumb. just more able to quickly form fine-grained associations. 

“In the agony of death a dog has been known to caress his master, and every one has heard of the dog suffering under vivisection, who licked the hand of the operator; this man, unless the operation was fully justified by an increase of our knowledge, or unless he had a heart of stone, must have felt remorse to the last hour of his life” -Darwin, Descent of Man


Darwin was wrong:
“a beaver, on the other hand, can make its dam or canal, and a bird its nest, as well, or nearly as well, and a spider its wonderful web, quite as well, the first time it tries as when old and experienced.” p 448 Descent of Man

why did he think this was important? he thought we relatively *overestimated* the cognitive achievements of 'lesser' animals, since we don't “realize” that they just magically do stuff by instinct “without any conscious intelligence on the part of the animal during each successive generation”.
this attitude seems sort of typical and expresses the 'instinct not consciousness' reductive pattern (the other one being 'associative learning, not cognition')



_do not say anything else about the game while she is playing it._


yeah so anti-pattern is to say 'they preferentially do x (spend time here, seek this kind prey, make whatever decision) because it is fitness enhancing'

. that just replaces the preference with teleology (a kind of magic). one read is to read that as shorthand for contingencies of the selective environment of phylogenetic significance. this still does a kind of magic act of assuming a sequence of phylogenetic events converging inexorably toward optimality. or some combination of phylogenetic adaptations and phylogeneticly adapted response ranges (learning as the product of selection).

better is to say the p



is concsciousness/cognition supposed to be an integrative/gap-bridging level of description, gap bridging can mean like neuro-hormonal control of behavior as well... like e.g. 'fear conditioning' how do you bridge gap between environmental contingencies and internal changes like neuro-hormonal states and muscular actions




so the thing with the antshrikes is that we did some space use analysis to figure out how and why birds in the multispecies flocks use space

turns out one follows the other and the focal birds cluster at the edge of vegetation and clearing. why??

the authors made the explanatory conjecture that the focal birds chose those spots because it suited a balance between vigilance and foraging — the way the antshrikes (?) forage, by upward sallying, gives good overhead visibility, i.e. vigilance against avian predators, so these spots are preferred.

so there is tons of literature on these trade offs, e.g. between foraging and vigilance. it all follow the optimality kind of inference pattern, X would be optimal, do we see X? hey we do. but how does X happen? what prevents deviations from X? what changes to tune the responses that prevent deviations from X as X changes?

so if birds are less vigilant about predators when they need to fatten up for migration (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00292976) how? how does this manifest in their bodies, how does it manifest in changes in the dynamics of their bodily movements, how does it manifest in changes in their motivation and attention (as inferred through the changes in dynamics of their bodies)?

what about yeah the antshikes we were thinking about the development of that preference...
so maybe its something like, when you're under cover there's an anxiety due to information hunger (you want to see that clear sky to know there isn't a hawk, otherwise there subjectively might be a hawk). so going to those spots is negatively reinforced by relief from information hunger.

or maybe its that enclosed spots are fear conditioned by specific attacks

the difference here in terms of ontogenetic environmental contingencies would be whether you need the attack to be aversive to the covered spots, or being fear conditioned to the predator and seeing the predator overhead and then not being able to look overhead? or do you not even need the predator to play a role? if you don't see hawks for like months do you stop caring?

but i guess there was supposed to be a point about embodiment here? like, we got this info about space use, what spots they like to use. but why? what explains the distribution? the distribution of trees. the way they forage

or maybe there is an 'innate' preference somehow, but if so how?




ok, so as for consciousness bringing it all together...

how do animals come to forage preferentially in certain areas, e.g. the dt ant shrikes in low vegetation?
some environments can be more stressful to forage in (Mateo squirrels)

is that stress itself aversive? if so, how? is it the stress of actual predator encounters (being attacked, being approached, seeing at a distance...) is it stress of vigilance? opportunity or energy cost of vigilance? how do opportunity and energy cost actually change behavior? thorugh conditioning? foraging opportunity cost could

this dude is badass for spatial cognition shit: https://www.tau.ac.il/~ilan99/publications.html

so the central problem i want to investigate is:
have we recovered the 'classical problem' of Darwin and Von Uexkull? that is, are we now studying animal *minds*? can we have an evolutionary/ comparative understanding of what it is like to be other animals, of what their lived experience of the world is?

does thinking of animals as having minds help to understand their behavior?

if so, i.e. positing a lived experience corresponding to an individual animal can help us to understand animal behavior, then by variously explicating and specifying the theory of this lived experience can lead to empirical predictions that can feedback to refine the theory

three themes in relating consciousness to behavior:

- the lived body as unifying principle/organizing structure in spatial cognition (orientation/navigation)

- hedonic valence (motivation/affect) as unifying principle in learning/action selection

- time-structure as unifying principle/organizing structure in learning (BItRIP as scaffold for fancy types of associative learning)

examples to discuss: (these are 'paradigm'-level examples)
- space use in multi-species bird interations
- individual recognition across invertebrates
- problem of pollinator runs?

anticipation in drosophila larvae:
“Conditioned olfactory behavior is therefore not responsive in nature but, rather, is an action expressed for the sake of those things that are not (yet) there, the sought-for reward and the attempted relief.”

“In the case of Drosophila larvae facing the test situa- tion, they may track down the odor, turn their back on the odor, or ignore it. In the latter case, they may ori- ent with respect to other, inadvertently applied stimuli and/or their conspecifics, start feeding on or digging into the substrate, or pupate. This behavioral richness is overlooked when our assay is performed because typically only olfactory behavior with respect to the trained odor is scored. For this scored learned olfac- tory behavior, we have argued that the larvae have the option to behaviorally express it—or not, and that this process is organized at the site of the circuit labeled by 4a and 4b in Figure 5.7. 
“

 
 
 
“We believe that the closest behavioral studies can get to a thus-understood ‘personal’ level is to focus on operant behavior and operant conditioning: A prerequisite for an animal to learn that its actions have particular consequences is that it recognizes itself as ‘subject’, as author of its actions and decisions. It will be interesting to determine whether Drosophila larvae, similar to adults, have such faculties.”

 
 
 
“This implies that much of neuronal activity, be it excitatory or inhibitory, is related to being able to potentially do things without actually doing them—and not to processing along sensorimotor loops.

A Multidisciplinary Approach to Learning and Memory in the Crab Neohelice (Chasmagnathus) granulata
Daniel Tomsic and Arturo Romano 

So these guys say that crabs learn to suppress their antipredator response

“Fiddler crabs, which feed in loops up to 1 m long, rely on path integration, sometimes called the ‘Ariadne’s thread mechanism,’ based on idiothetic information to integrate their foraging routes and to return to their dens. They walk on the ground and, like ants and spiders, store internal information from their limbs to ‘count’ the number of steps they take, an indication of short-term memory of acquired information. A direct view of the surrounding land- marks does not help them return home when they are passively displaced or translated.35 Hence, fiddler crabs rely on an egocentric system of references (idio- thetic memory). “

'store internal information from their limbs to count the number of steps they take'

Why I am Not a Cognitive Psychologist B.F. Skinner

can animal behavior/cognition research be 'object oriented'? can we do research on an animal's understanding of a given object? like, what is the nature of raven's concepts of their eggs? (or their nests, or some toy...)

do they have a concept that their eggs turn into babies (we can ask this for both first time and experienced parents)?

brood parasitism is crazy

if phenomenology traditionally attempts to discover invariants in consciousness, structures that are sine qua non, essential, we then want to know—what degrees and dimensions of variation do those structures permit while maintaining their essential form. what different consciousnesses are possible? further, how would we detect the differences—how can we reason from behavior to what kinds of consciousness a creature has?

is it actually about depth, and some kind of cliff where smaller animals are just off the cliff, the B placement is no longer in retention but longer term memory, on par with the training which has been more strongly reinforced to go A.

or is it just about retentional modification somehow... like you don't need to actually posit a cliff effect?

“But I suspect that there is also another reason for theories. Some of us, psychologically, just demand theories. Even if we had all the million and one concrete facts, we would still want theories to, as we would say, “explain” those facts. Theories just seem to be necessary to some of us to relieve our inner tensions.” 1938

The quest for an evolutionary understanding of mind: Darwin to present

!!!
Important early biologists and psychologists such as Darwin, James, and Von Uexkull assumed that non-human animals have mental processes such as perceptions, memory, emotions, and reasoning; they saw phylogenetic comparison and evolutionary, developmental, ecological and physiological explanations of these processes as core aims of the life sciences. The Behaviorist turn cast a taboo over the use of mentalistic concepts for decades, but their careful use has re-emerged in many areas of animal behavior research, as understanding behavior in terms of the cognitive, intentional and affective states of animals has proven to be both fruitful and perfectly compatible with experimental rigor. Theories of consciousness have also developed in ways that encourage a renewal of biology's early ambition toward a thoroughly evolutionary understanding of the mind. However, this will require further theoretical development, likely through engagement across disciplinary boundaries. Here I present some philosophical ideas which may be less known to experimentalists, but may serve useful in hypothesizing about how animals make their ways in the world and how these ways of life develop and evolve.

The Behaviorist turn sought to purge mentalistic concepts from science, and cast a taboo over their use.  Careful use of mental concepts has re-emerged throughout the behavioral sciences as it has proven to be both more fruitful to explain and predict animal behavior with reference to the cognitive, intentional and affective states of animals, than without, and to be perfectly compatible with methodological rigor, thanks to the ingenuity of experimentalists. Philosophical theories of consciousness have also developed over the decades, and increased engagement between these two areas of research promises rewards for both the theory of consciousness and our for our understanding of animal behavior and its ontogeny and evolution.

so what are the “ideas”?

Msj p305
ese archetypes range all the way from “form values” — Adolph Portmann’s term for morphological patternings, attributes, and conformations by which one animal recognizes another as being, for example, sexually disposed, male or female, young or mature, the alpha member of the group, and so on (1967) — to what may correlatively be termed “animate values” — postural, gestural, or otherwise kinetic patterns which articulate particular kinds of social relationships such as invitations, threats, reassurances, comfortings, and assaults, or which are a ectively expressive of feelings such as fright, sadness, surprise, disgust, and so on.



* Consciousness is embodied
    * how does the way animals use their body influence space use?
    * Intersubjectivity—perception of Maxine sheets johnstone form values and animate values. she says you understand animate values because you are an an8mate body. 
* Affect as concept unifying evo, devo, and performance of behavior. It's used as this fuzzily gap bridging concept. Anticipation and evaluation of hedonic consequences as mechanism of action selection. Is this supposed to *explain* operant conditioning? That's a very strong claim.
* conscious cognition is organized as a sequence of moments that have a certain structure
    * cognitive processes unfold in the context of a stream of consciousness guiding the behavior of the animal
    *  Thinking in terms of consciousness as a series of moments can be a framework
        * what is attended to, what object and in terms of what salient features? what other structure does this object have? 
        * what is the intention, what search image or goal image is driving the dynamics of protention-updating, what affective system is driving evaluation and branch collapse in the protention-tree?
        * e.g. space use, you can identify a given variable that controls space use but what does this mean? how do the variables that control space use aggregate/interact? 
        * “The Long-winged Antwrens likely know that the antshrikes give the perched calls only while perched. The antwrens may perceive the calls as anchoring the antshrikes to the current location of the flock, and so the antwrens may be more likely to stay in their current location than what would be expected at a random moment in time, i.e. the non-vocal treatment.” P49
        * can we tie space-use to cues?
        * why is space use so interesting, what do we want to know about space? what are the motivations and 'search images' or 'recognition images' broadly construed that are driving the animals behavior? what is it trying to do in goal directedness terms and what are the perceptual features of the environment it uses? what are the sources of motivation being traded off? (including information acquisition). like, the hypothesis is the antshrikes try to find spots at the edge of vegetation so they can forage but still have good visibility.


people often improperly invoke ultimate causation as a proxy for hedonic motivation. i.e. the animal sought X because it had 'high fitness value' or something. unpacking it, it means that the animals motivations and capacity to recognize an opportunity to do something it is motivated to do have been shaped by evolution, and that in this instance the animal recognized an opportunity to do something it is motivated to do. so really, it shells out to mentalistic explanation and just reassures us that we are still being scientific by referencing evolutionary history, even though this history and how it bears on the behavior in question may be unknown.

evolution of behavior in arhtropods (and in general fast life cycle high fecundity animals): 

* premium on canalization /innate (not requiring learning) expression of behaviors, perceptual discriminations,
* some invariants are imposed the development/evolution of consciousness by internal constraints? in what sense are they 'internal'
    * well they are internal to the organism, 
* they take meaning, ecological knowledge (the ability to engage in successful goal-directed behavior) from lineage history more than individual history relative to longer lived less fecund species. 
* one conception of the evolution of behavior is a random walk of genetically pre-determined traits
* the other conception is as tuned  or biased flexibility
* does high degree of canalization of ecological knowledge speak in favor of one conception reflecting the reality of evolution in a group, to the exclusion of the other? and further, does this determination speak against the reality of consciousness in the group? (spoiler, i think no and no)
* does this stand in contrast to ms-j's account of the genetic phenomenology, the mind building itself from the dynamics of the body? because there is knowledge just there, the body is just there, things in the world are just there. perhaps very little else is there, because the tradeoff (underlying the insect's neural efficiency as well) is that you have only very targeted species-specific knowledge, hence no culture, no social and emotional niceties, just the minimal barebones fly here mate there. hence no consciousness
* NO look at an actual fly, for example Drosophila melanogaster. This is one of the biologically best understood species of animal in the world, and we can avail ourselves of this information no less as phenomenologists than as geneticists or behaviorists. exploration flights are cool, what about mating and social stuff

Robot fish do not need sentience Commentary on Key on Fish Pain Antonio Chella
A powerful foil argument: biomimetic robots that do this need not be conscious
“it is difficult to explain what causal role sentience — the capacity to feel — would add to their robotic capacities”
http://animalstudiesrepository.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1039&context=animsent

first of all, robots could in principle be conscious. if we do build conscious robots it will probably be a result of working on biomimetics.

however also, any conscious behavior can be imitated by something is not conscious—consciousness can be 'proxied', because any possible neural network can be simulated in a serial computational architecture. but can be proxied in dumber ways too...

Why not think these robot fish are conscious?

* worries about simulation in a 'pseudo-concurrency' but really sequentially micro-operations system like current computers. a real nervous system encodes information through synchronous activity, allowing a big array of content to be available genuinely simultaneously, the information in a nervous system is simultaneously persistentent and truly synchronic complex distributed contents. whereas a computer performs sequential micro-operations that only add up to complex set of results, but these must really be interpreted
* what is missing is the open-ended developmental dynamics of consicousness, extracting invariants at multiple time-scales baed on hedonic feedback. well that's the *signature *of what's missing, but what's actually missing is 
    * can there be no consciousness without associative learning? could you not have a ontogenetically static conscious entity?

This consilience 

Consciousness is a stream of of moments

hedonicity 

**consciousness is not a module**, its more like an operating system

**consciousness is not an architecture**, its more a like construction process

take a given conscious adult animal — its mind is conscious, the architecture of this mind is not the architecture of consciousness per se, because the mind was conscious before it had its current architecture; consciousness was involved in building out this structure — consciousness is important 'developmental scaffolding', in other words.

you have some material here on C. elegans, an outgroup of 'the big three'. really the only other behavioral stuff you've looked at is that paper on annelids in the social recognition thing and a couple of quick papers on mollusks.


Skinner argued such mentalistic concepts are unverifiable/falsifiable, and sought to purge such them from the natural sciences, ushering in a Behavioristic turn essentially banned explanation of behavior in terms of anything other than environmental contingency, including cognitive and affective states. More recently, mental concepts have begun to re-emerge as working assumptions of investigation throughout the behaviors sciences; it has consistently proven easier to explain and predict animal behavior with reference to the perceptions, memories, motivations, and a variety of other mental characteristics of the animal, than otherwise. Furthermore, explaining animal behavior in terms of mental characteristics, and using a framework of mentalistic interpretation to guide research, have proven perfectly compatible with experimental rigor, thanks to the hard work of many talented field and lab workers, and in many cases the animals themselves. Griffin's 1972 critique of the ban on mentalism in animal behavior was met with fierce resistance, and was not without its flaws, but in its broad strokes it has enjoyed a long arc of empirical and methodological vindication. High standards of evidential rigor and interpretive minimalism are the legacies of the mid-20th century ban on mentalism, and the reintroduction of mental concepts into animal behavior science tends to be minimal, piecemeal and 'close to the operational metal', compared to the imaginative and grand-scaled theorizing of Darwin or Von Uexkull. As a result, there is a wealth of data on aspects of animal behavior, much of it taxon-specific, that reflects the mental in deep ways, but a dearth of potentially unifying theory.
Meanwhile, decades of progress in philosophy of mind and phenomenology have given us far better tools for analyzing the mind than were available to Darwin and Von Uexkull.

 I argue that the functional model of consciousness best supported by phenomenological and philosophical considerations also has great power as a model of dynamic control of complex bodies driven by affect-biased, object-oriented associative learning (Trestman 2016). 
The sort of complex bodies that require such flexibly coherent control systems evolved (conservatively) in the vertebrate, arthropod and cephalopod mollusk lineages, and those taxa also exhibit affect-biased associative learning (inadequate characterization!!), it is therefore a good bet is that consciousness has been an organizing principle in the evolution of behavior throughout the history of those lineages. In practical terms, there is theoretical justification for more liberal use of mentalistic working assumptions in animal behavior research, and more explicit targeting and operationalizing of mental phenomena. Through mutual co-evolution of the phenomenological and philosophical understanding of consciousness together with the science of animal behavior, researchers are beginning to deliver on the Classical Promise of an evolutionary comparative science of mind.

pain and welfar stuff is a must. 'targeting and operationalizing mental phenomena' lol you don't even know that literature

Themes

* the nature of search images — how do they vary, what are there dimensions? a systematic exploration would tell you a lot about how an animal experiences its environment; not just the search image but how search plays a role in the animals life as well; not just search images for prey but anything that must be discriminated, anything that *matters* to the animal. for a mate, for a home, for a place to hide in a moment of panic. 
* audio playback to trigger search behavior is cool, multimodal associations
* dimensions of inter-subjectivity
    * spatial control 
    * individual recognition, different kinds of recognition
            * but what we've seen is use of different model systems to map merely the existence of indivudal recognition, but what is the nature of the 

so think about dominance hierarchy and space use. so higher ranked animals use violence to keep lower ranked animals out of their preferred places, lower ranked have to anticipate how to move through space to avoid getting attacked inordinately, i.e. how *their *movement through space will trigger aggression or not, i.e. how the other is responsive to their behavior.

rich intersubjectivity does not require language, communication of emotional state is much more wide-spread, perception of others' bodies and actions is much more widespread

hermit crabs have to judge how much another crab will fight for a given shell

there's an organizing structure in common between the hermit crab doing the shell thing and an antwren following the flight call of her antshrike foraging partner. it's consciousness. in both cases the animal is trying to control the future, which implies an awareness of the future. In fact I think in both cases there is a BItRIP

This dude is into hierarchical and coherent goal-directedness, also action expectation and the need for animals to anticipate the hedonic consequences of action. Drosophila fun facts!

Next paper is amazing too.

Do bees have a preference for symmetry? Apparently they transfer 'symmetry good' more easily than 'asymmetry good' to a new data set, but is this because they've already learned 'symmetry good' from flowers? Or because they have an evolved preference for symmetry because of cooevolution w flowers? Do flowers have visual features that enhance their symmetry (or make it more obvious)? Some flowers it seems like are only visually symmetrical if you approach them 'from the front' — does the symmetrical display guide pollinators to the front? Is this a general convention?

Important of **exploratory behavior** in both papers. Bees and flies released in a novel room exhibit an exploration phase where they seem to like map out the room. It's duration depends on the size of the room. Blinded flies don't do it. After exploration, bees can travel direct, novel paths between spots, including when the target spot is specified by the frigging dance. How does that study work exactly?

Fuck dude bees trained with a two step y-maze thing where its like choose the fork with the symbol that matches (or doesn't match) the symbol you saw on the first door, can transfer that between color matching or pattern matching. That kinda means what, like do they fucking realize that they are in an experiment? That we are doing some shit with them and there's an answer to the task? I dunno...
It's a general concept of like matching (or antimatching) in the context of a y-maze.... what about if there there were different experimental procedures, like y-maze and push a button (can bees push little buttons, or is that not a thing they do? Can they learn to land on a platform? Or do they just shape the expression of complex actions like fly here and feed)
“Only by accepting that an attentive brain is constantly producing potential behaviors, most of which are not expressed, will we be able to search for the neural basis of the ‘inner doing’ as a prerequisite of decision- making processes” WOAH

“A revised version of this model was implemented on parallel programmable hardware in the form of a field programmable gate array and used to control a robot base”
Woah WTF is a 'field programmable gate array???' B-Webb is onto some crazy futuristic shit

So what would it take to make a robot like this conscious? Enough temporal depth to have pre-reflective self-awareness, like what does that mean, 10 layers? 3? How many is enough? I dunno minimal is one retention, and you try to predict actual based on retention, making the protention. At each step compare last time's protention with current actual. In humans we must have more than that, we are aware of temporally fine-grained rhythmic properties of perceived events and our own actions. Flicker fusion frequency == time resolution? Von Uexkull's hypothesis! 
But its more than that if you want objects to emerge ya know because they have temporal parts? but like how many? At what point is there a pre-reflective awareness of self as that which is always there, that for whom which, the 'I' in 'I can', the 'me' in 'my body, my skin, toward me, at me', and what about the even more fundamental now as opposed to then and soon. Me is what persists -- but also the world, things persist. I am for whom the world persists, changing though it persists, 

So is it the cross temporal awareness? The comparison of past expectation with current? 

But what about MS-J's point about how 'I move'/'I do' precede 'I can move/do'
Is it only when you start to objectify? Is pre-reflective self-awareness a pre-condition or a simultaneously co-constituting correlary and product of objectification?

The ecology and evolution of social behavior in microbes Corina E. Tarnita*


What does it mean to attribute consciousness? How can that attribution (or its negation) be supported to a greater or lesser degree by evidence?

You need some notion of what you are attributing. If you want your attribution to be verifiable, you need conditions of verification.

If you want your attribution to be paradigmatic, just spawn verifiable questions. Maybe things will go smoothly and you'll flesh out your model, maybe you'll break down, maybe you'll incrementally develop your model into something pretty different. For example the premise that living animals are descended from a long tree of unbroken lineages of biological reproduction are similar to each other in virtue of shared ancestry (and some times convergence). This is not being tested by biologists, it is a prior, or deeply rooted in the network...

Sometimes consciousness attribution is like this. With other humans, with our dogs...

Sometimes it can be tested, against a background of assumptions about what consciousness is like and how it can be operatinalixed. Maybe you are trying to figure out if someone is conscious or brain dead. Maybe you learn something about an animal you had assumed wasn't conscious that gives you pause. 
Large scale uncertainty about the distribution of consciousness in the world can be staggering.

Go diving in the Caribbean at night and hold a flashlight steady in front of you. Watch as wave after wave of krill and their hunters, squid, and little fish, swarm around you. Scale... ants? Plants? Bacteria?

Or try doing it with the proposition that children don't become conscious until the age of 5...

Anyway, usually it's something much more specific than consciousness, something that is empirically tractable in a small number of experiments.

Usually it is something that is as cleanly operationalizabke as possible. The operationalizabke thing must be *interesting* for some reason, some connection to something juicier, but not identical to it. It's left to other papers consuming the evidence produced here to take on the epistemic burden of interpretation.

Individual recognition is a great example of something... early, people assumed it was rare (altruism tie in) but in fact it is now known to be widespread. Indeed it seems to be exhibited largely wherever it makes sense ecologically, so the capacity for it seems super widespread in Arthropods (is that quite right?). Biological (eg size) or lineage constraints?

So it seems hard on the assumption that every cognitive trait evolved from nothing, each is a separate trait, a separate mechanism... but on the assumption that animals are aware of their environments and care about what happens to them it makes sense.
On this way of thinking, being an animal is learning how to make your way in the world, guided by urges and preferences and a progressively developing understanding of the world in terms of the most salient objects and affordances.

What does “aware of their environments” mean? Able to detect patterns in events over time? “Aware of thing” vs “responsive to cue”?

Subjectivity in animals — judgments, preferences


}

there *has* been a shift back in that people now study behavior in order to study the mind; it is patently not just behavior, but the existence and dynamics of a particular cognitive ability, and how this evolves, that is the object of study in a lot of animal behavior work. there are other reasons to study behavior: relation between behavior and ecological conditions is a classic. but even here, most behaviorists nowadays want to study *how *the animals approximates optimality ; is there a learning component, if so what do the animals cue to? how does approximating optimality in wrt the specific function relate to the rest of the animal's lifeway? how does it manifest in judgment and preference?

the talk overall is: have we rediscovered animal consciousness? we tried not to assume it or even investigate it for a while, but i think we have enough data to 'discover' consciousness in animals.

What are the most important discoveries since griffin?

Animal language is huge

it's actually really nice, from the perspective of a current investigator, that psychology, to the extent that it could, proceeded without being guided by a model of consciousness for much of the 20th century. if it had, one might worry that the appearance of robustness of the model could be due to research bias. but it doesn't seem that too many american animal psychologists were heavily influenced by husserl, right?

anyway, there's all this data about what animals do: what they notice, what they remember, how they learn, how they make decisions in nature and in the lab; in combination with a well-formulated theory of consciousness, it actually delivers quite a lot of the classical promise. 

I also happen to think that there is a single clear best theory of consciousness on the market, a neo-husserlian phenomenological account that I'll introduce here. This account can actually give us some really nice tools for thinking about how consciousness evolves, and combined with comparative behavioral evidence and the fossil and molecular historical record, allows us to home in on its likely points of origin in animal evolution.

the core funciton of conscious: to structure the output of the total associative network as a small set of projected future evolutions of the currently sensed environment that continuously evolves by collapse and reprojection


theme: rediscovering consciousness? in the sense of agency, subjectivity, hedonicity

animal intersubjectivities: communication as a window into consicousness. Why is communication a window into consciousness? just making a noise that causes a behavior in another animal, and if that animal made the same noise you'd do the same thing... so what?

subjectivity in the sense of transcendental subjectivity, i.e. the transcendence by the subject of what is experienced. cross-time identity.

subjectivity also in the sense of bias, selectiveness. we understand the environment in terms that are relevant to us, in terms of their affordances, their potential roles in our corporeal realities

animal senses are wildly different, their environments are different, their experienced worlds are very different.

subjectivity also in the sense of understanding the environment in terms of its possibilities, not (just) its actualities



agency in the sense of choosing actions

coherence...

emotional components of natural cognition (decision-making)

with space, navigation, Shettleworth's point that dead-reckoning is like a master mechanism: the sense of one's body is what allows the animal to make sense of space

with timing, what was it... oscilator model... there is integrated timing stuff... i don't remember what 


archimedean points: 

hedonic behaviorism—reinforcement valence as experienced motivation

So if something is a reinforced, anticipation of obtaining it is motivating, and actions are chosen based on projected consequences. 

homing; Heinrich emphasizes the *emotional* component of migration—the drive to push body to extremes of deprivation 


PREE — only mammals get frustrated? birds and fish have other 'non-emotional' strategies for coping with 'incentive switching'. phylogenetics of surprising non reward? i think that's the title

hypothesis: attributions of consciousness are *not *stating a matter of fact but espousing an attitude or stance where it is appropriate to engage in empathetic and imaginative perspective taking.

Denying that animals have consciousness in this sense is just saying 'fuck animals'

perhaps more realistically, attributions of consciousness are hybrid, both truth-apt and normative, emotive and/or prescriptive.

Did the transition from viscosity-dominated to inertia-dominated locomotion physics drive the origins of consciousness?

Time is different when you have inertia! you have to worry about accelerations, whereas you can ignore them more, the more relative importance viscosity has to inertia. So now you have to track time-series?

The Classical promise: we can understand the diversity of experience in the world, this is part of what biological science can deliver.


Darwin thought that mental characters evolved just as other traits, and thought that the diversity and evolution of mind would be part of biology; and that we would be able to explain the 

Von Uexkull's vision of a science of animal cognitive worlds; thought he was


Darwin and VU obviously differed in some way, but shared this idea that biology could elucidate other minds and allow us to compare our experience of the world with that of other animals.


Behaviorism snatched it away... (over simplified); Griffin tried to bring it back; to what extent was he correct?


relevance of cognition for study of behavior (has ethology grown more cognitive—YES learning, memory, maps, sociality, communication); so Griffin's bet that investing in cognition would pay off in terms of broader understanding of animal behavior seems to have payed off.

Cognition can't be ignored in animal science—what animals see, what they remember, what they can figure out how to do... these all matter for outcomes; you couldn't possibly predict outcomes without taking cognition into account.
What about consciousness?










but to focus more on agency and subjectivity (choice)—these themes are already big, as are personality

cognition to consciousness—what does it mean to make that move? Need a theory!

* is it 'non-cognitive' on our part? maybe it doesn't make any difference for science, it's more just an act of empathy—we don't usually do that with other humans anyway. Like, we get all the info from science without worrying about consciousness, just do cog sci

    * temporality/prediction
    * embodiment
    * importance of affect/motivation
* Relation of theories of consciousness to cognitive/behavioral findings--falsification vs development of theory


So—what can we infer about the lived experiences of other animals from what we know? I think quite a lot.

How does an animal percieve its environment 

What guides it's motion through space?

What motivates it? (behavior systems)

E.g. Dust bathing or social grooming for less obvious ones.

The ecological approach to phenomenology—we experience the world in terms of affordances, how this relates to husserlian “i cans”

Corporeal approach 

consciousness 'emerges' anew with every animal, just as it did in evolution. the developmental recapitulation of evolution is never more profound than with consciousness. except that is that true? there's a bunch of cushy newfangled support systems online nowadays.




A choice point at a flower


questions for the audience! end with some questions for take home or answer now:


* do you use any of the following assumptions in reasoning about animal behavior, if so how?
    * search images
    * animals anticipate 
* are there antipatterns that you see in the other people's reasoning (or worry about) that you want to call attention to?











i want to propose a toast, to my wife, Anne Love Willborn, and everything she's taught me about love, which, you know, she should be an expert, it is literally the woman's middle name.

she taught me that love is worthing changing plans


Love is a a continual process of saying yes, of looking at the other person, of hearing them, of discovering who they are in some new way, and saying yes, yes i choose this, yes this is right, this is very good. 







Dear Anne,

Good morning :) I hope you slept well and that the bed at the hotel is comfortable.
We are married now, and so I can finally call you my wife for reals. I've probably been lying in bed for some time now watching you, my wife, sleep and listening to your peaceful breathing. I was doing that for a while now (at time of writing, not time of reading) before I got up to write this. I look forward to doing it on thousands of happy mornings. I love lying in bed with you sleeping beside me. Anne, I am so excited and happy about our life together. i have never looked forward to my own life as much as I do now

Soul-mates (or just 'mates' really) are not pre-determined in this world. Nobody else decided that you are for me and I am for you. We decided that, together. It is you and I that choose to make that true. I promise to continue to choose that, to choose you, to choose us. I promise to work continually to be a better partner and lover and friend, to make this my life's work.

I promise to help you enjoy the best of life and protect and support you as much as i can against the worst.
I promise to respect your wishes, preferences, opinions and understandings as much as my own.
I give you the keys to everything that is me: my truest inner thoughts and desires and fears, my vulnerabilities. I want to share everything with you, the best moments of my life will be better with you, and in the worst moments our love will be what i cling to for support. I vow to safeguard and cherish you in the same way, to accept everything that is you, every twist or oddity in your character or your life or your body, no matter how weird you think it is, without hesitation or reservation, to be there for you no matter what. I love you.
